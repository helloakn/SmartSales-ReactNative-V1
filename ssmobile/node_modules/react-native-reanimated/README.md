React Native Reanimated provides a more comprehensive,
low level abstraction for the Animated library API to be built
on top of and hence allow for much greater flexibility especially when it
comes to gesture based interactions.

## Installation

Check [getting started](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-reanimated/getting-started.html) section of our docs for the detailed installation instructions.

## Documentation

Check out our dedicated documentation page for info about this library, API reference and more: [https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-reanimated](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-reanimated)

## Examples

The source code for the example (showcase) app is under the [`Example/`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/blob/master/Example/) directory.
If you want to play with the API but don't feel like trying it on a real app, you can run the example project. Clone the repo, go to the Example/ folder and run:

```
yarn install
```

### Running on iOS

Before running the app, install the cocoapods dependencies:

```
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Now, you can start the app:

```

```

### Running on Android
